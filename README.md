# Clean Water Prioritization Tool

As part of the Ecosystem Services Assessment (ESA), the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute has developed a Clean Water Prioritization Tool (CWPT) to help guide municipalities in maintaining and enhancing water-related ecosystem services throughout their jurisdiction. Improvement of water quality is an important goal among many municipalities, and practical guidance on where to target conservation and management efforts to achieve ecosystem service gains in an efficient manner is needed. 

The CWPT is a mapping product designed to give landowners, decision-makers, and extension agents information on the relative importance of each quarter-section in contributing to the provision of clean surface water, as well as guidance on appropriate management actions.
