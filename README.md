The Clean Water Prioritization Tool (CWPT) has been developed to provide guidance to interested stakeholders in maintaining and enhancing water-related ecosystem services throughout their area of interest. The CWPT was built to provide practical guidance on where to target conservation and management efforts in an efficient manner. 

The CWPT is a mapping product designed to provide users information at the quarter-section scale. Landowners, resource managers, and extension agents can use the CWPT to determine the relative importance of each quarter-section in contributing to the provision of clean surface water, as well as receive guidance on management actions appropriate to that particular quarter.
